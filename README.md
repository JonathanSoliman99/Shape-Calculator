# Shape-Calculator
*__This <strong>~600-lined project</strong> is an engine that can calculate almost <strong>ANY</strong> shape descriptions, such as their <em>area/volume, their circumference, surface area, perimeter,</em> and more, using Python. It may be still under development, but I try my best to <em>improve</em> it.
<br> <br>This is a project that I code for fun and to help me in my everyday life. But I also learn others and make projects with modules like rich for decoration, error handling, math for mathematical functions as well as numpy and sympy, some experience in OS as well as JSON, and a handful of other modules.__*
