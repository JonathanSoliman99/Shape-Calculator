# Shape-Calculator
This <strong>~130-lined project</strong> is an engine that can calculate almost <strong>ANY</strong> shape descriptions, such as their <em>area/volume, their circumference, surface, area, perimeter,</em> and more using Python. It may be still under development, but I try my best to <em>improve</em> it.
This is also a project that I sometimes code for fun, since i was inspired by someone. But I also learn things and make projects with modules like rich to decorate the result, error handling, math, numpy, sympy, some experience in OS, and a handful of other modules.
