# Shape-Calculator
This <strong>~130-lined project</strong> is an engine that can calculate almost <strong>ANY</strong> shape descriptions, such as their <em>area/volume, their circumference, surface, area, perimeter,</em> and more using Python. It may be still under development, but I try my best to <em>improve</em> it.
This is also a project that I sometimes code for fun, since i was inspired by someone. But I also learn others and make projects with modules like rich for decoration, error handling, math for mathematical functions as well as numpy and sympy, some experience in OS as well as JSON, and a handful of other modules.
