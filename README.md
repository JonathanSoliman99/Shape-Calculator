# Shape-Calculator
This <strong>~130-lined project</strong> is an engine that can calculate almost <strong>ANY</strong> shape descriptions, such as their <em>area/volume, their circumference, surface, area, perimeter,</em> and more using python. It may be still under development, but I try my best to <em>improve</em> it.
